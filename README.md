# Breast_Cancer_Classification

    • A 3 layer Deep Neural Network is implemented which predicts based on the input features, whether the 
      cancerous cell is benign or malignant.

    • The data is processed by modifying the class column to indicate 0 as benign or 1 as malignant. 
      
    • The data is read from a csv file obtained from an online open source platform. 
      
    • The model is implemented using Tensorflow and uses AdamOptimizer to optimize the model.

    • The number of hidden units in the first layer is 25, in the second it is 12 and finally the third layer 
      has a softmax unit with two output values.

    • The output also shows a plot of cost for all iterations and the accuracy obtained for training and test samples.
